# Getting Started with TQ

TQ (Transcription & Quote) is a system by LivoCare designed for aesthetic clinics and healthcare professionals. It helps you transcribe consultations, generate quotes, create clinical notes, and produce prevention documents — all from a single recorded session.

## Logging In

1. Open the Hub portal at hub.livocare.ai in your browser.
2. Enter the email and password provided by your clinic administrator.
3. After logging in to the Hub, you will see your available applications. Click the **TQ** application card.
4. TQ opens automatically using Single Sign-On (SSO) — you do not need to enter your credentials again.
5. If this is your first time, the Admin user will see an **Onboarding Wizard** to help configure the clinic.

To change your password, click **Change Password** at the bottom of the Hub sidebar. A modal opens where you enter your current password and set a new one. Your new password applies to all LivoCare applications.

## Official Website

The official LivoCare website is **livocare.ai**. From there you can learn about the product, sign up, and access the Hub portal at **hub.livocare.ai**.

## Mobile Access

You can install LivoCare as an app on your phone — no app store needed. Visit **livocare.ai/install-app** for step-by-step instructions for iOS and Android.

On mobile, each app shows a simplified bottom navigation bar:

- **Hub mobile** (2 buttons): Open TQ, Logout. Only the Home page is accessible on mobile. To access Marketplace or Configurations, use a desktop or laptop.
- **TQ mobile** (3 buttons): New Session, Sessions, Patients. Support (headphones icon in the header) and the AI chat also work on mobile. Documents, templates, landing pages, and configurations are desktop-only.

You can also access LivoCare from a mobile browser through hub.livocare.ai without installing.

## The Overall Workflow

The typical workflow in TQ follows these steps:

1. **Create a session** — Start a new consultation session and select or register the patient.
2. **Record or upload audio** — Use live transcription with your microphone, or upload a pre-recorded audio file.
3. **Review the transcription** — The AI converts speech to text. You can edit the text to fix any errors.
4. **Generate documents** — From the session, create one or more documents: a quote, a clinical note, or a prevention document. AI fills templates automatically using the transcription.
5. **Share with the patient** — Send quotes via a secure landing page link, or print/export clinical notes as PDF.

## User Roles

TQ has three roles that determine what each user can do:

- **Admin**: Full access to all features. Only role that can see the **Configurations** menu, manage clinic settings, branding, and email templates. Can manage the subscription and licenses via the Stripe Portal (accessible from Hub > Configurations > Transcription). Sees the Onboarding Wizard on first login.
- **Manager**: Full access to create sessions, templates, quotes, clinical notes, and documents. Cannot access the Configurations menu. Ideal for doctors and senior staff who create and manage their own consultations.
- **Operations**: Basic access for support staff. Can view existing sessions, patients, and documents, but cannot see the **New Session** button or create new sessions. Suitable for receptionists or administrative staff who need to look up information.

New users are not created inside TQ. They are provisioned automatically during the Stripe checkout process when your clinic purchases additional seats.

## Practical Tips

- Bookmark hub.livocare.ai for quick access every day.
- If you get logged out unexpectedly, simply log in to the Hub again and click TQ.
- If TQ does not load after clicking the card in Hub, try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser (Chrome or Edge recommended).
- Each user has their own login. Do not share credentials between staff members.
- If you forget your password, use the "Forgot Password" link on the Hub login page to reset it via email.

## Frequently Asked Questions
