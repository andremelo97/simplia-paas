# Patients

The patient database is the foundation of your clinic's workflow in TQ. Every session, quote, clinical note, and prevention document is linked to a patient record. Keeping your patient information accurate and complete ensures smooth day-to-day operations.

## Creating a Patient

There are two ways to add a patient:

1. **From a New Session**: When you create a new transcription session, start typing a patient name. If TQ does not find a match, it will automatically create a new patient with that name. This is the fastest way to add patients on the fly during consultations.
2. **From the Patients Page**: Navigate to **Patients** in the sidebar and click **Create Patient**. Fill in the patient details and save. Use this method when you want to enter complete information upfront, such as before a scheduled appointment.

## Patient Fields

- **First Name** (required) - The only mandatory field. Use the patient's legal first name for consistency.
- **Last Name** (optional) - Recommended for distinguishing patients with similar first names.
- **Email** (optional) - Enables sending quotes, prevention documents, and clinical notes directly to the patient. Highly recommended.
- **Phone** (optional) - Useful for contact purposes and as a secondary way to identify a patient.
- **Notes** (optional) - A free-text field for any additional information (allergies, preferences, referring doctor, etc.).

## Searching for Patients

You can search for patients from the Patients page or from the global search bar in the header:

- **Search by name**: Type any part of the first or last name. The search matches from the beginning of the word, so typing "Mar" will find "Maria", "Marco", and "Mariana".
- **Search by email**: Type any part of the email address to find the matching patient.
- **Search by phone**: Type part of the phone number to locate a patient.
- All searches are case-insensitive, so "maria" and "Maria" return the same results.

## Patient List

- View all your patients from the **Patients** page in the sidebar.
- Sort patients by name or creation date to find who you need quickly.
- Click on any patient row to open their full profile and history.

## Patient History Timeline

Each patient profile shows a complete timeline of all interactions:

- **Sessions**: Every transcription session conducted for the patient, with date and status.
- **Quotes**: All quotes generated for the patient, including their current status (Draft, Sent, Viewed, Accepted).
- **Clinical Notes**: All clinical notes created from the patient's sessions.
- **Prevention Documents**: All preventive care plans linked to the patient.

This timeline gives you a full picture of the patient's journey at your clinic. You can click on any item in the timeline to open it directly.

## Why You Cannot Delete a Patient with Active Sessions

TQ protects your clinical data. If a patient has any associated sessions, quotes, clinical notes, or prevention documents, the system will not allow you to delete that patient. This ensures:

- No clinical records are accidentally lost.
- Audit trails remain intact for compliance.
- Linked documents (shared quotes, prevention plans) continue to work.

If you truly need to remove a patient, you would first need to ensure no active records are linked. For most clinics, it is better to simply stop creating new sessions for that patient rather than deleting them.

## Best Practices

- **Always add an email address**: Without an email, you cannot send quotes or prevention documents to the patient electronically. Adding an email at registration saves time later.
- **Keep names consistent**: Use the same spelling every time. If you type "Maria" once and "maria silva" another time, TQ may create two separate patient records.
- **Use the Notes field**: Record useful details like allergies, insurance info, or referring physician. This information is visible on the patient profile for quick reference.
- **Check before creating**: When starting a new session, type at least 3 characters of the patient name and wait for suggestions. This prevents duplicate patient records.
- **Add phone numbers**: Even though it is optional, having a phone number helps identify patients and serves as a backup contact method.

## Troubleshooting

- **Duplicate patients**: If the same patient appears twice, it usually means their name was spelled differently in two sessions. You can update the patient details on their profile page to keep information consistent. Contact support if you need to merge records.
- **Cannot send documents to a patient**: Check that the patient has a valid email address on their profile. Without it, TQ cannot send emails.
- **Patient not appearing in search**: Make sure you are typing at least the first few characters of their name, email, or phone. The search matches from the beginning of words, not the middle.
- **Cannot delete a patient**: The patient has linked sessions or documents. This is by design to protect clinical data integrity.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I edit a patient's information after creating them?**
A: Yes. Open the patient profile and update any field. Changes take effect immediately.

**Q: What happens to shared documents if I change a patient's email?**
A: Previously shared links remain active. New emails will be sent to the updated address.

**Q: Is there a limit to how many patients I can add?**
A: No. You can add as many patients as your clinic needs.

**Q: Can two patients have the same name?**
A: Yes, but it is recommended to add last names or use the Notes field to distinguish them.
