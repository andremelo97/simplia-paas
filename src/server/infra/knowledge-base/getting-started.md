# Getting Started with TQ

TQ (Transcription & Quote) is a system by LivoCare designed for aesthetic clinics and healthcare professionals. It helps you transcribe consultations, generate quotes, create clinical notes, and produce prevention documents — all from a single recorded session.

## Logging In

1. Open the Hub portal at hub.livocare.ai in your browser.
2. Enter the email and password provided by your clinic administrator.
3. After logging in to the Hub, you will see your available applications. Click the **TQ** application card.
4. TQ opens automatically using Single Sign-On (SSO) — you do not need to enter your credentials again.
5. If this is your first time, the Admin user will see an **Onboarding Wizard** to help configure the clinic.

To change your password, go to Hub > Profile > Change Password. Your new password applies to all LivoCare applications.

## Official Website

The official LivoCare website is **livocare.ai**. From there you can learn about the product, sign up, and access the Hub portal at **hub.livocare.ai**.

## Mobile Access

You can install LivoCare as an app on your phone — no app store needed. Visit **livocare.ai/install-app** for step-by-step instructions for iOS and Android. The mobile app supports sessions, new sessions, patient management, and support (both the support modal and the AI support chat work on mobile). It is ideal for recording consultations, checking patient data on the go, and getting help from the AI assistant. For full access to all TQ features (documents, templates, quotes, landing pages), use a desktop or laptop computer.

You can also access TQ from a mobile browser through the Hub at hub.livocare.ai without installing. The interface is responsive and works on phones and tablets.

## The Overall Workflow

The typical workflow in TQ follows these steps:

1. **Create a session** — Start a new consultation session and select or register the patient.
2. **Record or upload audio** — Use live transcription with your microphone, or upload a pre-recorded audio file.
3. **Review the transcription** — The AI converts speech to text. You can edit the text to fix any errors.
4. **Generate documents** — From the session, create one or more documents: a quote, a clinical note, or a prevention document. AI fills templates automatically using the transcription.
5. **Share with the patient** — Send quotes via a secure landing page link, or print/export clinical notes as PDF.

## User Roles

TQ has three roles that determine what each user can do:

- **Admin**: Full access to all features. Only role that can see the **Configurations** menu, manage clinic settings, branding, and email templates. Can manage the subscription and licenses via the Stripe Portal (accessible from Hub > Transcription Usage). Sees the Onboarding Wizard on first login.
- **Manager**: Full access to create sessions, templates, quotes, clinical notes, and documents. Cannot access the Configurations menu. Ideal for doctors and senior staff who create and manage their own consultations.
- **Operations**: Basic access for support staff. Can view existing sessions, patients, and documents, but cannot see the **New Session** button or create new sessions. Suitable for receptionists or administrative staff who need to look up information.

New users are not created inside TQ. They are provisioned automatically during the Stripe checkout process when your clinic purchases additional seats.

## Practical Tips

- Bookmark hub.livocare.ai for quick access every day.
- If you get logged out unexpectedly, simply log in to the Hub again and click TQ.
- If TQ does not load after clicking the card in Hub, try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser (Chrome or Edge recommended).
- Each user has their own login. Do not share credentials between staff members.
- If you forget your password, use the "Forgot Password" link on the Hub login page to reset it via email.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **Can I use TQ on my phone?** Yes. You can install LivoCare as an app on your phone by visiting livocare.ai/install-app, or access it through the Hub in your mobile browser. The mobile version supports sessions, new sessions, patients, and support (contact human support or chat with the AI assistant). Full features (documents, templates, landing pages) are available on desktop.
- **How do I add a new user to TQ?** New users are added through the Stripe subscription portal. Contact your Admin to purchase an additional seat.
- **What browser should I use?** Chrome or Edge are recommended for the best experience. Safari and Firefox also work but may have minor differences with audio recording.
- **I clicked TQ in the Hub but nothing happened.** Make sure pop-ups are not blocked in your browser. TQ opens in the same tab, so check if the page is loading. Try refreshing.
- **What does the Operations role do?** Operations users can view sessions and documents but cannot create new sessions. This role is designed for front-desk staff who need to look up patient information or print documents.
