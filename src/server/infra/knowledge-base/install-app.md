# Installing the LivoCare App

LivoCare is a Progressive Web App (PWA). This means you can install it on your phone or tablet directly from the browser — no app store needed. It works like a native app with its own icon on your home screen.

## Official Website

The official LivoCare website is **livocare.ai**. From there you can learn about the product, access the Hub portal at **hub.livocare.ai**, or visit the install page at **livocare.ai/install-app** for step-by-step instructions with visual guides.

## What Is Available on Mobile

The mobile version of TQ is optimized for quick data checking and audio recording. The following features are available:

- **Sessions**: View and manage your consultation sessions list.
- **New Session**: Create new transcription sessions — record audio live or upload a pre-recorded file.
- **Patients**: View and manage patient records (view details, edit info).

**What is NOT available on mobile**: Patient history, document creation (quotes, clinical notes, prevention documents), templates, landing pages, and configurations. For full access to all TQ features, use a desktop or laptop computer.

The mobile app is best suited for:
- Recording consultations on the go
- Checking patient information before or during appointments
- Reviewing and editing transcriptions
- Starting sessions that you will complete later on desktop

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **What is a PWA?** A Progressive Web App is a website that can be installed on your device and behaves like a native app. It has its own icon, opens in full screen, and loads quickly.
- **Does it take up storage space?** Very little — only a few megabytes. Much less than a traditional app from the app store.
- **Is it the same as a native app?** It is very similar. It opens from your home screen, works in full screen, and supports push notifications. The main difference is that it is installed from the browser, not from an app store.
- **How do I uninstall it?** The same way you remove any app: long-press the icon and select Remove or Uninstall.
- **Will I receive notifications?** Notification support depends on your device and browser. Most modern Android devices support push notifications from PWAs. iOS support is available on iOS 16.4 and later.
- **Does it work offline?** Basic navigation and cached data are available offline. However, transcription, document generation, and data syncing require an internet connection.
- **I cannot find the "Add to Home Screen" option.** Make sure you are using a supported browser (Safari on iOS, Chrome or Samsung Internet on Android). Other browsers may not support PWA installation.
