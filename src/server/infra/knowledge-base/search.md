# Search

TQ provides a powerful quick search feature that lets you find anything in your clinic's data in seconds. The search bar is located in the top header of the application and is always accessible from any page.

## How to Search

1. Click the search bar in the top header of TQ, or use the keyboard shortcut to open it.
2. Start typing your search query.
3. Results appear instantly, grouped by category, as you type.
4. Click on any result to navigate directly to that item.

## The 7 Searchable Categories

Search covers everything in your TQ workspace:

1. **Patients** - Search by first name, last name, email, or phone number. This is the fastest way to pull up a patient and see all their records.
2. **Sessions** - Search by session number (e.g., SES000001) or by the patient name associated with the session.
3. **Quotes** - Search by quote number (e.g., QUO000001) or by content within the quote.
4. **Clinical Notes** - Search by clinical note number (e.g., CLN000001) or by content within the note.
5. **Prevention Documents** - Search by prevention document number (e.g., PRV000001) or by content within the document.
6. **Templates** - Search by template title or description. Finds both clinical note templates and prevention templates.
7. **Landing Page Templates** - Search by template name to find your landing page designs.

## How Search Works

- **Case-insensitive**: Typing "maria", "Maria", or "MARIA" all return the same results.
- **Partial match from the start**: The search matches from the beginning of words. Typing "Mar" will find "Maria", "Marco", "Mariana", and "Marcos". However, typing "ria" will not find "Maria" because it does not start with those letters.
- **Instant results**: Results appear as you type, so you often find what you need after just a few characters.
- **Grouped by category**: Results are organized under their category headings (Patients, Sessions, Quotes, etc.), making it easy to scan.
- **Quick identification**: Each result shows the most relevant information at a glance, such as patient name, document number, or status.

## Practical Examples

- **Find a patient quickly**: Type the first 3 letters of their name. For example, typing "Joh" will show "John Smith", "Johanna Lee", and any other patient whose name starts with "Joh".
- **Look up a specific session**: Type the session number "SES000045" to go directly to that session.
- **Find all records for a patient**: Type the patient's name in the search bar. You will see results across all categories - their patient profile, all sessions, quotes, clinical notes, and prevention documents linked to them.
- **Find a quote by number**: If a patient calls asking about quote "QUO000012", type that number to pull it up instantly.
- **Locate a template**: Type part of the template name, like "Botox" or "Facial", to find matching clinical note or prevention templates.

## Tips for Effective Searching

- **Start with the patient name**: This is the most effective way to find everything related to a patient in one search. Their sessions, quotes, notes, and prevention documents will all appear.
- **Use document numbers for precision**: When you know the exact document number (SES, QUO, CLN, PRV), type it for an instant match.
- **Type at least 3 characters**: While search works with fewer characters, typing at least 3 gives you more specific results and reduces noise.
- **Use search instead of browsing**: Rather than scrolling through long lists on the Patients or Sessions page, use the search bar. It is much faster.
- **Search works from any page**: You do not need to navigate to a specific page first. The search bar in the header is always available.

## Troubleshooting

- **No results found**: Double-check your spelling. Try fewer characters or a different part of the name. Remember, search matches from the beginning of words only.
- **Too many results**: Add more characters to narrow down the results. For example, instead of "Ma", type "Mari" to reduce matches.
- **Cannot find a recently created record**: The search updates in real time. If you just created a patient or session, it should appear immediately. Try refreshing the page if it does not show up.
- **Search bar not visible**: Make sure you are logged in and on a TQ page. The search bar appears in the top header area.
