# Prevention Documents

Prevention documents are forward-looking preventive care plans that you create for your patients. While clinical notes record what happened during a consultation, prevention documents outline recommended treatments, follow-up schedules, and care plans for the future. They are a key tool for patient engagement and proactive healthcare.

## What Prevention Documents Are

A prevention document is a professional care plan that you can share with your patient. Typical uses include:

- Recommended treatment plans (e.g., a series of aesthetic procedures over several months)
- Preventive care schedules (e.g., follow-up visits, skin care routines)
- Post-procedure care instructions and timelines
- Long-term wellness plans with milestones

Prevention documents are different from clinical notes. A **clinical note** documents what happened during a session (observations, procedures performed, findings). A **prevention document** looks ahead and outlines what should happen next (recommendations, scheduled treatments, care plans).

## Creating a Prevention Document - Complete Workflow

1. **Start from a session**: Open an existing session for the patient, then click **Create Documents**.
2. **Select a template**: Choose a prevention template from your library. Templates provide a pre-structured format so you do not have to start from scratch.
3. **AI assistance**: TQ can use AI to fill in the template based on the session transcription. The AI reads the session content and generates a draft prevention plan tailored to the patient.
4. **Review and edit**: Use the rich text editor to review the AI-generated content and make any changes. You can add, remove, or modify sections as needed. The editor supports formatting like headings, bold, italic, lists, and more.
5. **Save as draft**: Save the document. It starts in **Draft** status, meaning only you can see it.
6. **Share with the patient**: When ready, click **Share** to send the prevention document to the patient via email.

## Prevention Document Numbering

Each prevention document receives a unique sequential number in the format **PRV000001**, **PRV000002**, and so on. This makes it easy to reference specific documents in conversations with patients or colleagues.

## Status Lifecycle

Prevention documents go through three stages:

1. **Draft** - The document has been created but not yet shared with the patient. You can continue editing it freely.
2. **Sent** - The document has been shared with the patient via a landing page link. An email with the link and password was sent to the patient's email address.
3. **Viewed** - The patient has opened the landing page and viewed the document. TQ tracks when and how many times the document was viewed.

## Sharing Prevention Documents with Patients

1. Open the prevention document you want to share.
2. Click the **Share** button.
3. Select a landing page template to use for the public page, or use the default template.
4. TQ automatically generates an **8-character password** for security.
5. An **email is automatically sent** to the patient containing the landing page link and the password.
6. The patient clicks the link, enters the password, and views their prevention plan.
7. The document status changes to **Sent**, and then to **Viewed** once the patient opens it.

## Password Protection and Access Control

- Every shared prevention document is password-protected. The patient must enter the password to view the page.
- You can **revoke access** at any time by clicking the revoke option on the shared document. Once revoked, the link no longer works.
- You can **generate a new password** if the patient loses or forgets theirs. Generating a new password automatically re-sends the email with the updated password.
- View tracking shows you whether the patient has seen the document and how many times they viewed it.

## Using Templates

- Templates save time by providing pre-built structures for common prevention plans.
- Your clinic can create multiple templates for different specialties or procedure types.
- Templates can be found and managed under the Templates section.
- The AI fills templates more effectively when they have clear section headings.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Review AI content carefully**: The AI does a good job drafting prevention plans, but always review the content for accuracy before sharing with a patient.
- **Add the patient email first**: Make sure the patient has an email address in their profile before trying to share. Without it, TQ cannot send the document.
- **Use clear template names**: Name your templates descriptively (e.g., "Post-Botox Care Plan", "Annual Skin Check Follow-Up") so you can find the right one quickly.
- **Share promptly**: Patients are most engaged right after their consultation. Send the prevention document the same day if possible.
- **Track engagement**: Check the Viewed status to see if patients are reading their care plans. If a document stays in Sent status for too long, consider following up by phone.

## Troubleshooting

- **Cannot share a prevention document**: Ensure the patient has a valid email address on their profile. Also confirm that your clinic's SMTP (email) settings are configured in the Hub.
- **Patient says they did not receive the email**: Check that the patient's email address is correct. Ask them to check their spam or junk folder. You can also generate a new password, which re-sends the email.
- **Patient forgot the password**: Go to the shared document and click the option to generate a new password. A new email with the updated password will be sent automatically.
- **Document shows as Sent but patient says they viewed it**: The status updates when the patient opens the landing page. If they viewed it on a different device or the page did not fully load, the status may not have updated. Ask them to open the link again.
- **AI-generated content seems off**: The AI uses the session transcription as context. If the session recording was short or unclear, the AI output may be incomplete. In these cases, edit the document manually.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I create a prevention document without a session?**
A: Prevention documents are created from sessions, as the AI uses the session transcription to generate content.

**Q: Can I edit a prevention document after sharing it?**
A: You can edit the document content, but the shared landing page reflects the version at the time of sharing. For updates, you may need to re-share.

**Q: How many prevention documents can I create per patient?**
A: There is no limit. You can create as many prevention documents as needed.

**Q: Can I print a prevention document?**
A: Yes, you can print or export prevention documents from the editor view.
