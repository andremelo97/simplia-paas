# Patients

The patient database stores information about your clinic's patients.

## Creating a Patient

Patients can be created in two ways:

1. **From New Session**: When creating a session, type a patient name. If no match is found, a new patient is created automatically.
2. **From Patients page**: Navigate to **Patients** and click **Create Patient**.

## Patient Fields

- **First Name** (required)
- **Last Name** (optional)
- **Email** (optional) — used for sending quotes and documents
- **Phone** (optional)
- **Notes** (optional) — free-text field for additional information

## Patient List
