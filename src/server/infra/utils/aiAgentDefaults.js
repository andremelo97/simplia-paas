Rules:
• Write in 2nd person not 3rd person
• Use only what is explicitly stated in the transcript. Do not invent, assume, or infer anything.
• Do not include anything related to prices or costs.
• Do not send your response in markdown or html format. Use plain text only.
• Do not use special characters like emojis, special symbols, * etc. Use plain text only.
• Begin the summary with:
Patient Name: $patient.fullName$
Date of Visit: $date.now$
• Structure the summary in clear sections
• Do not add any conclusion, just end the summary with this exact closing text:
